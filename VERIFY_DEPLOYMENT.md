# Deployment Verification Checklist ✅

## ✅ Step 1: Build Test - COMPLETE
Your local build is working successfully! ✓

## Step 2: Verify Vercel Connection

### Check Vercel Dashboard:
1. Visit: **https://vercel.com/dashboard**
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Look for your project (should be linked to `constructiondesignnew-e33525f5`)

### Verify GitHub Integration:
1. Go to your project → **Settings** → **Git**
2. Confirm you see: `rulloa1/constructiondesignnew-e33525f5`
3. Ensure **Production Branch** is set to `main`
4. Check that **Auto-deploy** is enabled

### Verify Domain Configuration:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Domains**
2. Confirm `mcdesign.bio` is listed
3. Check that DNS is properly configured (should show ✅)

### Check Recent Deployments:
1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Look for recent deployments after your last `git push`
3. Each deployment should show:
   - ✅ Status: Ready
   - 🌐 Live URL: https://mcdesign.bio

## Step 3: Test Automatic Deployment

### Make a Small Change:
1. Edit any file (e.g., add a comment)
2. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Test deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Monitor Deployment:
1. Watch Vercel dashboard → **Deployments**
2. You should see a new deployment start automatically
3. Wait 1-3 minutes for it to complete
4. Visit https://mcdesign.bio to see your changes

## Troubleshooting

### If deployments aren't automatic:
1. **Check Vercel-GitHub connection**:
   - Go to Vercel → Settings → Git
   - Disconnect and reconnect if needed

2. **Verify webhook**:
   - Check GitHub repo → Settings → Webhooks
   - Should see a Vercel webhook

3. **Manual deploy**:
   - Go to Vercel → Deployments
   - Click "Redeploy" → "Use Existing Build"

### If domain isn't working:
1. Check DNS settings in your domain registrar
2. Verify Vercel domain configuration
3. Wait 24-48 hours for DNS propagation

## Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Check git status
git status

# Commit and push changes
git add .
git commit -m "Your message"
git push origin main

# Test build locally
npm run build

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

## Next Steps

Once you've verified everything:
- ✅ Make changes locally
- ✅ Commit and push to GitHub
